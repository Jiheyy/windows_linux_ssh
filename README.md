# windows_linux_ssh
connection between windows and linux

send file from linux to windows.

1. send run python script command from linux server.
2. In windows server pyhon script run.
3. python script creates result file in windows.
4. linux send read the result file which is in windows server.
5. Therefore, we can get result from program which is only support for windows.

So now it is possible to not only run a program which only support windows and check the result.

These code should be on linux server not windows.
To use this code, you should create script (on windows) to run programs what you want and write the result on txt file.
